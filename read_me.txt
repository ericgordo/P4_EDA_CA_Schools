This project is an exploratory analysis on publicly found data on California schools. There is no political interests, but instead was just an exploration of my own curiosity.

The Data used for this analysis was collected from the California Department of
Education. (http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/)

The Final data frame used for this project uses the following column headers.
